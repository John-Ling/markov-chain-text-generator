# Markov Chain Text Generator 

Build
```
make
```

## How to Use

```
./bin/generate order isAscii truncate wordCount pathToTextFile
# order: number of previous words used to create ngram. (order 1 means bigrams, 2 trigrams etc)
# isAscii: Keep as 1 by default. Use 0 if using logographic languages (Chinese, Korean, Thai, Arabic etc)
# truncate: Generate a complete text that ends on a full stop at the cost of potentially going over the word count. Set to 1 to generate a fixed word count
# wordCount: How many words to generate
# pathToTextFile: relative path to text file
```
