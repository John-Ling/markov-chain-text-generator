Yeah, yeah, yeah (when you fall, when you fall)
I don't fuck with your tone (I don't fuck with your tone)
I don't wanna go home (I don't wanna go home)
Can it be one night?
Can you?
Can you?
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see?
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't want to slow dance)
In the dark
Dark
In the dark
Dark
Lately, I've been slippin' away from you
Can you tell me, does it hurt today?
Yeah, there's no way, yeah (no way, no way, no way)
To burn, there's no flames, yeah (there's no flames)
Praying nine to five like a saint for you (like a saint)
Can you tell me how it turned this way? (How?)
Yeah, things have changed, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, filled with rage, yeah (filled with rage)
So lost in these diamonds
So lost in this paradise
Don't speed on that highway
We need you to shine bright
When life gets too complicated
Please stand with me after dark
I'll stay in the limelight
Like a beautiful afterthought
Like a beautiful afterthought
Sometimes, you'd ask me for something different
Hated when you did it, I wish that you didn't
I would do things and you'd get annoyed
I should've never done them, I wish I was different
Why do we have to step away now?
It's been a year, been a couple days now
Since you called me sayin' you're worried
Been hard for me dealin' with this space now
No company, wishin' we could sit down
'Cause I'm sorry, but you don't want me
So lost in these diamonds
So lost in this paradise
Don't speed on that highway
We need you to shine bright
When life gets too complicated
Please stand with me after dark
I'll stay in the limelight
Like a beautiful afterthought
Like a beautiful afterthought
I don't wanna forget about you
I don't wanna forget about you, oh
I don't wanna forget about you
I don't wanna think about it
Think about it
I looked at you and said, oh-oh-oh
Don't hate me, am I crazy?
So tenderly you watch me burn, you watch me burn, oh
So tell me, am I crazy?
'Cause I do, 'cause I do
'Cause I do, 'cause I do
'Cause I do, 'cause I do
Ooh
La-la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la, la, la (goddamn)
Ooh (oh)
And I don't wanna die
No, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I fell for your magic
I tasted your skin
And though this is tragic
At least I found the end
I witness your madness
You shed light on my sins
And if we share in this sadness
Then where have you been?
I know you're not in love
Like you used to be
Guess I'm not the one
Like you used to think
So you just run
I know that I'm stuck
In this misery
Guess I'm not enough
Like you used to think
So I'll just run
You bathe in your victory
You blew out on my fuse
And if I took on the planet
Will I pay my dues?
Your love was a mystery
Yeah my love is a fool
And I traveled the country
Just to get to you
I know you're not in love
Like you used to be
I guess I'm not the one
Like you used to think
So you just run
I know that I'm stuck
In this misery
Guess I'm not enough
Like you used to think
So I'll just run
I know you're not in love
I know you're not in love
I know you're not in love
Too many, too many things we did together
You used to promise me it would be forever
Feeling like the end, don't think it will get better, baby
Too many, too many things we did together
You used to promise me it would be forever
Feeling like the end, don't think it will get better, baby
Please come down so we can get out
I've waited too long to get your voice out of my head (out of my head)
Out of my head (out of my head)
Feels like home, I'm covered in stone
I know you'll think twice, I'm waiting by the window, babe (window, babe)
Window, babe (window, babe)
Too many, too many things we did together
You used to promise me it would be forever
Feeling like the end, don't think it will get better, baby
Too many, too many things we did together
You used to promise me it would be forever
Feeling like the end, don't think it will get better, baby

Swear I couldn't sleep a wink last night
No point in turnin' off the lights
Not the same without your head on my shoulders
Growin' pains, but I don't wanna get older
Almost like we left it all on read
Couple feelings never laid to rest
Didn't know that the party was over
And it's true that I need you here closer
Burning photos
Had to learn to let go
I used to be
Somebody in another skin (another skin)
I heard that you're happy without me
And I hope it's true
(I hope, I hope it's true)
It kills me a little, that's okay
'Cause I'd die for you
You know I'd still die for you
I hope you're getting everything you needed (needed)
Found the puzzle piece and feel completed (completed)
Just wanted you to know every reason
Hope you really know that I mean that
I couldn't see
The forest from the trees
Only time we speak
Is in my dreams
Burning photos
Had to learn to let go
I used to be
Somebody in another skin (another skin)
I heard that you're happy without me
And I hope it's true
(I hope, I hope it's true)
It kills me a little, that's okay
'Cause I'd die for you
You know I'd still die for you
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
Swing around front, let me inside
Playin' my song into my sides
It hurts, I can't lie
Remember those times I fought to get out?
I want to get out
Those pictures so clear, the fade in my mind
You leavin' me here with ashes and fire
These people don't heal, these people don't feel
These people aren't real, so make me this deal
Won't you?
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
Look into your heart and let me know
Do things turn black and gray as they go?
When I'm far too gone, can you show me love? (Ooh)
Give me love (ooh)
Caught in a river of records and dreams
Oh, will you keep up with me?
Everyone's looking for someone to hold
But I can't let you go
I got knots all up in my chest (up in my chest, up in my chest)
Just know, I'm trying my best (I'm trying my best)
'Cause, when you look (when you look)
When you laugh (when you laugh)
When you smile (when you smile)
I'll bring you back (bring you back)
And now I'm sad (now I'm sad)
And I'm a mess (and I'm a mess)
And now we high (now we high)
That's, why I left (why I left)
That's, why I left
Will your tongue still remember the taste of my lips? (my lips, my lips, my lips)
Will your shadow remember the swing of my hips? (my hips, my hips, my hips)
Will your lover caress you the way, that I did? (I did, I did, I did)
Will you notice my charm, if he slips up one bit? (one bit)
'Cause I don't need to know
I just wanna make sure you're okay (okay)
I don't need to know
I just wanna make sure you're all safe, all safe, all safe
Will he play you those songs, just the way, that I did? (I did, I did, I did)
Will he play you so strong, just the way, that I did? (I did)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Will he treat you like shit, just the way, that I did? (I did, I did, I did)
'Cause I don't blame ya
'Cause I don't need to know
I just want to make sure you're okay (okay)
I don't need to know
I just want to make sure you're all safe
Go ahead and bark after dark
Fallen star, I'm your one call away
Motel halls, neon walls
When night falls, I am your escape
When you lay alone, I ache
Something I wanted to feel
If you've been waiting for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need
Not anyone, you're the one
More than fun, you're the sanctuary
'Cause what you want is what I want
Sincerity
Souls that dream alone lie awake
I'll give you something so real
If you've been waiting for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need
Pull me, oh, so close
'Cause you never know
Just how long our lives will be
If you've been waiting for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need
